 We consider the task of clustering items using answers from non-expert crowd
workers. In such cases, the workers are often not able to label the items
directly, however, it is reasonable to assume that they can compare items and
judge whether they are similar or not. An important question is what queries to
make, and we compare two types: random edge queries, where a pair of items is
revealed, and random triangles, where a triple is. Since it is far too expensive
to query all possible edges and/or triangles, we need to work with partial
observations subject to a fixed query budget constraint. When a generative model
for the data is available (and we consider a few of these) we determine the cost
of a query by its entropy; when such models do not exist we use the average
response time per query of the workers as a surrogate for the cost. In addition
to theoretical justification, through several simulations and experiments on two
real data sets on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we empirically demonstrate that, for a
fixed budget, triangle queries uniformly outperform edge queries. Even though,
in contrast to edge queries, triangle queries reveal dependent edges, they
provide more reliable edges and, for a fixed budget, many more of them. We also
provide a sufficient condition on the number of observations, edge densities
inside and outside the clusters and the minimum cluster size required for the
exact recovery of the true adjacency matrix via triangle queries using a convex
optimization-based clustering algorithm.

 We study the problem of clustering a set of data points based on their
  similarity matrix, each entry of which represents the similarity between the
  corresponding pair of points. We propose a convex-optimization-based algorithm for
  clustering using the similarity matrix, which has provable recovery guarantees. It needs no prior knowledge of the number of clusters
  and it behaves in a robust way in the presence of outliers and noise. Using a
  generative stochastic model for the similarity matrix (which can be thought of
  as a generalization of the classical Stochastic Block Model) we obtain \emph{precise bounds} (not orderwise)
  on the sizes of the clusters, the number of outliers, the noise variance, separation between the mean similarities inside and outside the clusters
  and the values of the regularization parameter that guarantee the exact recovery of the clusters with high probability. The theoretical findings are corroborated
  with extensive evidence from simulations.

We consider the problem of finding clusters in graphs which are partially
observed. We analyze two programs based on regularized nuclear norm
minimization, with a goal to recover the low- rank part of the adjacency
matrix. For the commonly used Stochastic Block Model, we provide explicit
conditions in terms of the size and sparsity of the clusters, amount of observed
data, and the regularization parameter of the convex program that guarantees
successful recovery of the clusters. We also corroborate our theoretical findings
with extensive simulations, and also run our algorithms on a real data set
obtained from crowdsourcing an image classification task on Amazon Mechanical
Turk.

                We analyze a popular approach towards identifying clusters in graphs, that of a
sparse plus low-rank decomposition of the adjacency matrix of a graph via a
simple and intuitive convex program. We sharply characterize the conditions for
the success and failure of this program in identifying clusters. We also present
extensive simulations that corroborate our theoretical findings.

        <li>We investigated whether measures of productivity based on citation
        centrality could explain academic salary. </li>

        <li>We analyzed 18 years of citation network data for Theoretical High
        Energy Physics to compute various centrality measures. We obtained the
        salary data of professors in public schools, and fitted a linear model
        incorporating the measure of centrality and seniority.</li>

       <li>Our study showed that the simple measure of citation count and
       seniority predicted salary with high confidence while sophisticated
       measures (like h- and g-indicies) failed to do so. </li>
